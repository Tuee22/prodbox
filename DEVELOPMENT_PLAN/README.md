## Standards

See [development_plan_standards.md](development_plan_standards.md) for the maintenance rules that
govern this plan suite.

## Closure Status

Phases `0` through `7` are closed on the supported Haskell-only end state. Sprints `2.1`,
`2.2`, and `2.3` remain closed on the daemon basics, the TLA+ formal-verification entrypoint,
and the single-record Route 53 doctrine. Sprints `2.4`, `2.5`, `2.6`, and `2.7` are closed on
peer heartbeat transport with commit-log gossip, runtime claim/yield emission under the
`CanWriteDns` gate, operator time-base discipline, and atomic Orders-promotion coordination.
The TLA+ model's peer-transport, claim/yield, and bounded-delay safety belt is now enforced at
runtime through `Prodbox.Gateway.Peer`, the daemon's `peerListenerLoop` and `peerDialerLoop`
threads, the runtime `canWriteDns` predicate, and `daemonMaxClockSkewSeconds`. The final
clean-room rerun and handoff validation close on the canonical `prodbox` command surface with
no remaining phase-owned cleanup residue.

The current worktree closes on:

- one Haskell-owned CLI, lifecycle, Pulumi, gateway-daemon, public-workload, chart, onboarding,
  AWS, and test surface
- one direct `Dhall -> Haskell types` config contract rooted at repository-authored
  `prodbox-config.dhall`
- one Harbor-first local lifecycle that reconciles MetalLB, Envoy Gateway, cert-manager, Harbor,
  MinIO, and the Percona PostgreSQL operator on the supported self-managed cluster path
- one supported public-edge doctrine where every externally reachable application or dashboard sits
  behind Envoy Gateway on `test.resolvefintech.com`, distinguished only by explicit path prefixes
  such as `/auth`, `/vscode`, `/api`, `/ws`, `/harbor`, and `/minio`, protected by Keycloak-
  backed JWT auth or RBAC, and covered by one Route 53 record plus one listener certificate
- one native-host-architecture lifecycle image-publication doctrine where `amd64` hosts build and
  publish only `amd64` images, `arm64` hosts build and publish only `arm64` images, and no
  supported path uses `docker buildx` or cross-arch emulation
- one explicit steady-state JWT boundary where Envoy validates Keycloak-issued tokens locally and
  does not require per-request Keycloak or Redis calls on the hot path
- one explicit Keycloak availability boundary where new logins, refresh flows, and later JWKS
  refresh depend on Keycloak, while the steady-state JWT hot path at Envoy does not require
  per-request Keycloak or Redis access
- one explicit distinction between the Envoy Gateway public edge and the separate Haskell
  distributed gateway daemon shipped through `prodbox gateway ...` and
  `prodbox charts deploy gateway`
- one explicit current transport boundary where public TLS terminates at Envoy and backend TLS or
  mTLS stays outside the supported chart-workload contract unless a later doctrine revision
  expands that path
- one Redis surface that currently backs WebSocket shared state and may later back an explicit
  external rate-limit service, but does not yet ship a standalone rate-limit-service workload or
  validation surface
- one cleanup ledger that preserves completed removal history and currently lists no pending
  supported-path cleanup items

The implemented clean-room rerun proof remains the Phase `6` command contract expressed through
`prodbox test all`, `prodbox config show`, `prodbox config validate`, and
`prodbox host public-edge`. Separate repository review gates still verify that `example.com` and
zero-Python residue stay out of supported-path sources, but those checks are not a dedicated
`prodbox` command. The canonical automated validation contract otherwise remains the `prodbox`
command surface documented by this plan: `prodbox check-code`,
`prodbox test unit`, `prodbox test integration cli`, `prodbox test integration env`, and the
named native validations behind `prodbox test integration ...`. Environment-dependent AWS and
public-edge proof remain attached to those commands rather than recorded here as a fresh
execution log.

The rewrite remains on the canonical phase model required by
[development_plan_standards.md](development_plan_standards.md).

|--------|---------|-------|
| **Done** | Deliverables implemented for the sprint-owned surface, validated, and aligned in docs | ✅ |
| **Active** | Work has started and remaining implementation or documentation work is explicitly listed | 🔄 |
| **Blocked** | Closure depends on an unmet prerequisite or prior sprint closure | ⏸️ |
| **Planned** | Ready to start once execution reaches the sprint in sequence | 📋 |

### Definition of Done

A sprint can move to `Done` only when all of the following are true:

1. Its deliverables are implemented in the worktree.
2. Its validation commands pass through the canonical `prodbox` surface.
3. The docs listed in `Docs to update` are aligned with the implemented behavior.
4. Sprint-owned cleanup is reflected in
   [legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md](legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md).
5. No sprint-owned blocker or remaining work survives.

**Status interpretation**: the Haskell-only rewrite baseline, shared-host public edge, native-
host-architecture lifecycle, cleanup closure, gateway-protocol completeness, and final
clean-room handoff are all validated on the supported Haskell command surface. The TLA+-modelled
safety belt for peer transport, claim/yield emission, bounded clock skew, and Orders-promotion
coordination is now enforced at runtime by the gateway daemon.

## Current Plan Status

The development plan is current against the repository worktree on the following implemented
surfaces:

- `src/Prodbox/Settings.hs` preserves the supported direct `Dhall -> Haskell types` contract by
  decoding repo-root `prodbox-config.dhall` through `dhall-to-json` without materializing
  `prodbox-config.json`.
- `src/Prodbox/BuildSupport.hs`, `src/Prodbox/Repo.hs`, and `test/integration/env/Main.hs`
  preserve the operator-facing `.build/prodbox` artifact contract, repository-root config-path
  resolution, and the built-frontend env proof for the direct-Dhall settings surface.
- `src/Prodbox/CheckCode.hs` now enforces the governed doctrine-alignment contract described by
  `documents/engineering/code_quality.md`: it fails on repository-owned workflow or git-hook
  surfaces before it runs Fourmolu, HLint, warning-clean Cabal builds, and the operator-binary
  sync step, while excluding generated or retained runtime roots such as `.build/`,
  `dist-newstyle/`, `.prodbox-state/`, and `.data/` from the repo-owned policy scan.
- The supported public surface is Haskell-only. Python source, Python packaging, Python tests,
  Python Pulumi programs, Python type stubs, and Python bridge modules are removed.
- The supported config contract is direct `Dhall -> Haskell types`; `prodbox-config.json` and
  `prodbox config compile` are not part of the supported path.
- The public `config setup` and public `aws ...` surfaces use prompt-driven temporary elevated AWS
  credentials, while stored `aws_admin_for_test_simulation.*` remains reserved for test-suite
  simulation of that prompt input, with the native IAM validation harness as the only supported
  runtime consumer.
- `src/Prodbox/TestPlan.hs`, `src/Prodbox/TestRunner.hs`, and `src/Prodbox/TestValidation.hs`
  now route `prodbox test integration aws-iam`, `prodbox test integration all`, and
  `prodbox test all` through one shared suite-level IAM harness that provisions temporary
  operational `aws.*` before prerequisite-driven AWS validation begins and clears those
  credentials again before the suite returns.
- `src/Prodbox/TestPlan.hs`, `src/Prodbox/TestRunner.hs`, `src/Prodbox/Prerequisite.hs`, and
  `src/Prodbox/EffectInterpreter.hs` now split the aggregate prerequisite model into an initial
  fail-fast gate plus a deferred cluster-backed backend proof, so `prodbox test integration all`
  and `prodbox test all` no longer fail at `pulumi_logged_in` before the visible `rke2 install`
  phase has created or repaired the supported MinIO-backed Pulumi backend.
- The shared IAM harness deletes any pre-existing dedicated `prodbox` IAM user and that user's
  access keys, uses any pre-existing `aws.*` only to discover and delete the IAM user associated
  with those credentials, materializes operational `aws.*` only from
  `aws_admin_for_test_simulation.*`, and clears `aws.*` from `prodbox-config.dhall` before
  returning even on later prerequisite failure.
- Supported AWS subprocesses now strip ambient AWS auth and profile variables before projecting
  repository-root credentials into the subprocess environment, so supported paths cannot fall back
  to host AWS auth state.
- The supported container topology lives entirely under `docker/`. Every repository-owned
  Haskell-build Dockerfile stays single-stage `ubuntu:24.04`, installs `ghcup` in-image, pins GHC
  `9.14.1`, and does not create symlinked Haskell tool shims.
- The local lifecycle is Haskell-owned and Harbor-first: Harbor plus Harbor's storage backend may
  bootstrap from public registries, after which required public images and custom images are
  present in Harbor before later Helm deployments proceed.
- The Harbor mirror path retries transient Harbor publication failures on the same candidate and
  then falls through to alternate configured upstreams when publication still fails after manifest
  inspection, with `mirror.gcr.io` fallbacks now covering the Docker Hub-hosted Percona and Envoy
  images used by the supported lifecycle.
- The Haskell-owned lifecycle now retries transient upstream Helm fetch failures during
  `helm repo update` and `helm upgrade --install`, so clean-room restore does not fail terminally
  on intermittent upstream `5xx` or timeout errors.
- `src/Prodbox/CLI/Rke2.hs` now closes the supported lifecycle on native-host-architecture image
  publication only: `amd64` hosts publish `amd64`, `arm64` hosts publish `arm64`, and no
  supported lifecycle path uses `docker buildx` or cross-arch emulation.
- The chart-platform end state is Haskell-owned and renders namespace-local
  Percona-operator-backed Patroni PostgreSQL HA through `src/Prodbox/PostgresPlatform.hs` and
  `src/Prodbox/Lib/ChartPlatform.hs`, with exactly three replicas, synchronous replication,
  deterministic retained PV bindings, retained secret state, and no embedded chart-local
  PostgreSQL subcharts.
- The public `prodbox pulumi ...` surface is limited to the AWS validation stacks under
  `pulumi/aws-eks/` and `pulumi/aws-test/`. Non-secret validation inputs are synchronized through
  stack config, while AWS provider credentials stay only in `prodbox-config.dhall` and the
  Haskell-owned subprocess environment.
- `src/Prodbox/Infra/AwsTestStack.hs` and `src/Prodbox/Infra/AwsEksTestStack.hs` generate and
  retain AWS validation stack snapshots under `.prodbox-state/aws-test/` and
  `.prodbox-state/aws-eks-test/`, with the HA-RKE2 validation SSH key stored under
  `.prodbox-state/aws-test/`.
- The current gateway runtime surface is Haskell-owned and code-backed in `src/Prodbox/Gateway.hs`,
  `src/Prodbox/Gateway/Daemon.hs`, `src/Prodbox/Gateway/Peer.hs`, and
  `src/Prodbox/Gateway/Types.hs`: config generation, heartbeat recording, in-memory ownership
  projection, DNS-write gating, the bounded HTTP `/v1/state` observability payload, HMAC event
  signing, Orders-backed gateway-interval validation, peer-transport gossip with commit-log
  replication through `peerListenerLoop` and `peerDialerLoop`, runtime claim/yield emission under
  the `canWriteDns` predicate, bounded-clock-skew enforcement keyed off
  `daemonMaxClockSkewSeconds`, and monotonic Orders-version coordination across the mesh are all
  implemented there today.
- `src/Prodbox/Tla.hs` still owns `prodbox tla-check`, while
  `documents/engineering/tla_modelling_assumptions.md` records the current runtime-to-model
  correspondence and compression points for the Phase `2` surface.
- `src/Prodbox/CLI/Rke2.hs` retains lifecycle-owned bootstrap DNS reconcile and ACME
  `ClusterIssuer` projection; those helpers do not expand the public `prodbox pulumi ...` command
  family.
- `src/Prodbox/CLI/Rke2.hs` now closes the supported lifecycle on the clean-room Harbor, Envoy
  Gateway, cert-manager, and Percona reconcile path with no retained cluster-migration cleanup
  shims for Traefik or the pre-Percona operator surface.
- `src/Prodbox/Infra/AwsTestStack.hs` and `src/Prodbox/Infra/AwsEksTestStack.hs` now sync only
  the supported retained AWS-validation stack inputs and no longer remove older Pulumi
  provider-key layouts on the supported path.
- The self-managed public edge now installs Envoy Gateway, renders Gateway API resources, and
  protects shared-host browser, API, WebSocket, and admin routes through Envoy auth policy.
- `src/Prodbox/CLI/Rke2.hs` now renders config-selected MetalLB L2 or BGP resources, lifts the
  Envoy Gateway controller and data-plane replica counts into settings, and builds or imports both
  the gateway image and the shared public-edge workload image during `rke2 install`.
- The supported public-edge auth doctrine now makes the carrier and key-discovery boundary
  explicit: JWT-only API routes validate request-carried bearer tokens locally at Envoy from
  Keycloak issuer metadata plus JWKS-backed signing keys, Envoy-managed browser auth returns
  through the edge redirect and cookie or session path, and direct-OIDC workloads keep their
  carrier or session state workload-owned.
- Keycloak availability now stays explicit in the plan: it is required for new logins, refresh
  flows, and later JWKS refresh, but the steady-state JWT request path does not synchronously call
  Keycloak or Redis while Envoy still has cached signing keys and the presented tokens remain
  valid.
- The current supported transport boundary now stays explicit in the plan: public TLS terminates at
  Envoy for the shipped `/vscode`, `/api`, and `/ws` routes on
  `test.resolvefintech.com`, while backend TLS or mTLS is outside the supported
  chart-workload contract unless a later doctrine revision expands that path.
- `src/Prodbox/PublicEdge.hs` now centralizes the shared-host route catalog and issuer derivation
  consumed by lifecycle, DNS, chart, host-diagnostic, and native validation surfaces, keeping
  `/auth`, `/vscode`, `/api`, `/ws`, `/harbor`, and `/minio` aligned on one Haskell-owned
  public-edge contract.
- Root `README.md` plus the governed command-surface, public-edge, and chart-platform doctrine
  docs now describe that same single-host route catalog and no longer present dedicated public
  subdomains as part of the supported path.
- `charts/keycloak/`, `charts/api/`, `charts/redis/`, `charts/websocket/`, `charts/vscode/`,
  `src/Prodbox/Lib/ChartPlatform.hs`, and `src/Prodbox/Workload.hs` now own the shared-host
  workload contract, including the internal `PRODBOX_WORKLOAD_MODE=api|websocket` runtime,
  JWT-only API delivery, Redis-backed shared-state continuity on the WebSocket route, workload-
  managed OIDC bootstrap, real `/ws` upgrade handling, and settings-backed workload scaling.
- The current WebSocket doctrine now states that one upgraded connection remains pinned to one
  selected backend pod until disconnect, reconnect-safe state must live outside the pod, and the
  implemented runtime now closes on readiness-based drain plus revocation-driven reconnect
  behavior on the real `/ws` path.
- Redis now stays explicit as shared application state for the current WebSocket surface and any
  later explicit external rate-limit service, but the current supported worktree still does not
  ship a standalone rate-limit-service workload or validation path.
- `src/Prodbox/Host.hs` and `src/Prodbox/TestValidation.hs` now classify and validate the
  current Keycloak identity, `vscode`, `api`, `websocket`, Harbor, and MinIO routes through named
  external validations on one shared hostname.
- `charts/gateway/` and `prodbox gateway start|status|config-gen` remain the separate Haskell
  distributed gateway daemon surface; they are not the Envoy Gateway public edge.
- The canonical validation surfaces are `prodbox check-code`, `prodbox test unit`,
  `prodbox test integration cli`, `prodbox test integration env`, the named native validation
  flows in `src/Prodbox/TestValidation.hs`, and the aggregate reruns
  `prodbox test integration all` plus `prodbox test all`.
- The aggregate rerun contract is owned by the shared suite plan behind
  `prodbox test integration all` and `prodbox test all`, including AWS IAM,
  Route 53, public-edge, EKS, HA-RKE2, destructive lifecycle, and post-test restore.
- The final Phase `6` destructive rerun and handoff validation are closed on that aggregate rerun
  contract and the supported postflight restore path.
- The legacy ledger preserves completed cleanup history and is back at zero pending supported-path
  residue after the Phase `6` doc-harmony follow-up removed the stale governed-doc backlinks to the
  deleted `METALLB_ENVOY_KEYCLOAK_REDIS_WEBSOCKETS.md` planning doc.

## Exit Definition

This plan is complete only when all of the following are true:

1. `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/` and governed doctrine describe the Haskell architecture and the Envoy
   Gateway target rather than the retired Python architecture or a Traefik end state.
2. The supported operator flow is `prodbox`, implemented in Haskell, across config, lifecycle,
   Pulumi orchestration, gateway, chart delivery, validation, and AWS administration.
3. The supported config contract is direct `Dhall -> Haskell types` from operator-authored
   repository-root `prodbox-config.dhall`, with `prodbox-config-types.dhall` aligned to the
   decoder and no generated `prodbox-config.json` artifact or supported `prodbox config compile`
   path.
4. Public `prodbox config setup` and public `prodbox aws ...` paths can bootstrap all required AWS
   credentials from scratch using temporary elevated credentials entered interactively by the
   operator.
5. `aws_admin_for_test_simulation.*` may be stored in `prodbox-config.dhall` only as the
   test-suite simulation of the ephemeral elevated credential prompt. The native IAM validation
   harness is the only supported runtime consumer of that section, and no supported non-test
   command or runtime helper may read or use it.
6. `prodbox test integration aws-iam`, `prodbox test integration all`, and `prodbox test all`
   share one joint idempotent IAM validation harness that deletes any pre-existing dedicated
   `prodbox` IAM user and all of that user's access keys before provisioning, uses any
   pre-existing `aws.*` credentials only to discover and delete the IAM user associated with those
   credentials, materializes operational `aws.*` only from `aws_admin_for_test_simulation.*` to
   simulate the interactive public CLI workflow, and clears operational `aws.*` from
   `prodbox-config.dhall` before returning so no test-created dedicated IAM user or key survives.
7. The operator-facing binary lives at `.build/prodbox`, produced by the canonical
   `cabal build --builddir=.build exe:prodbox` invocation plus a copy step.
8. Container-side build artifacts live under `/opt/build`, and every repository-owned Dockerfile
   lives under `docker/`.
9. Every repository-owned Haskell-build Dockerfile is single-stage from `ubuntu:24.04`, installs
   `ghcup` in-image, pins GHC `9.14.1`, and does not create symlinked Haskell tool shims; no
   supported browser-facing auth path depends on a repository-owned nginx auth-proxy image.
10. `prodbox.cabal`, `cabal.project`, and the canonical build-and-test surfaces are explicitly
    upgraded for GHC `9.14.1`, including any required cabal-bound changes and full canonical
    validation reruns on that toolchain.
11. `prodbox check-code` enforces the governed doctrine-alignment contract described by
    `documents/engineering/code_quality.md`, not only formatter, linter, build, and binary-sync
    checks.
12. The Haskell distributed gateway runtime, `gateway status` client path, and daemon config
    validation close on the implemented bounded HTTP `/v1/state` observability payload, the
    Orders-backed gateway-interval relationships enforced by `src/Prodbox/Gateway/Types.hs`, and the current
    correspondence notes in `documents/engineering/tla_modelling_assumptions.md`.
13. The self-managed public edge uses MetalLB, Envoy Gateway, Kubernetes Gateway API, and
    cert-manager rather than Traefik plus `Ingress`.
14. Every externally reachable application or operational dashboard routes through Envoy on the
    single canonical hostname `test.resolvefintech.com`, using explicit path prefixes such as
    `/vscode`, `/api`, `/ws`, `/auth`, and later supported admin paths.
15. The supported public-edge doctrine uses exactly one public DNS entry, one listener
    certificate, and no dedicated identity, browser, API, or WebSocket hostnames. Wildcard
    public DNS is unsupported.
16. `prodbox host public-edge`, `prodbox test integration charts-vscode`,
    `prodbox test integration charts-api`, `prodbox test integration charts-websocket`, and the
    named admin-route validations close on Gateway, `HTTPRoute`, auth policy, certificate, and
    one Route 53 record rather than `IngressClass`, `Ingress`, or per-FQDN state.
17. Supported config, onboarding, lifecycle, and validation surfaces remove `example.com`
    entirely and do not accept or emit placeholder public domains.
18. MetalLB supports both the L2 implementation path and a config-selected BGP implementation path
    on the supported self-managed cluster surface.
19. Envoy validates Keycloak-issued JWTs locally and applies route-level RBAC for application and
    admin routes. Issuer, audience, path-claim requirements, bearer-token carriers, browser
    return paths, and JWKS discovery or refresh ownership remain explicit.
20. Redis appears only as repo-owned app-level shared state for supported realtime or rate-limit
    workloads; it is never part of Envoy JWT validation, and the current supported worktree does
    not yet ship a standalone external rate-limit-service surface.
21. Supported WebSocket workloads authenticate at connection setup on the shared-host `/ws`
    route, keep reconnect-safe state outside the pod, keep each live upgraded connection pinned
    to one backend pod until disconnect, define token-expiry and authorization-change behavior
    explicitly, leave per-message authorization to the workload when messages need finer-grained
    permissions than the edge can enforce, scale horizontally behind Envoy, use readiness-based
    drain before pod exit, and add named validations for reconnect, connection-pinning,
    token-expiry handling, authorization-change assumptions, readiness-based drain,
    per-message authorization ownership, and shared-state assumptions.
22. Keycloak-backed public workloads stay proxy-aware behind Envoy on the shared hostname rather
    than on a dedicated identity host. Keycloak availability gates login, refresh, and later
    JWKS refresh, while cached signing keys and unexpired tokens keep the steady-state JWT hot
    path local to Envoy.
23. Public TLS terminates at Envoy on the supported path, and one certificate covers
    `test.resolvefintech.com`. Backend TLS or mTLS is not part of the current supported workload
    contract unless a later doctrine revision makes that backend transport explicit.
24. Direct public-registry pulls are permitted on the supported path only for Harbor and Harbor's
    storage backend during bootstrap.
25. Every later supported Helm deployment obtains its images from Harbor.
26. `prodbox` idempotently ensures required public images and all custom images are present in
    Harbor after Harbor bootstrap and before those later deployments.
27. Supported custom-image builds and Harbor publication use only the native architecture of the
    machine running `prodbox`: `amd64` hosts build and publish `amd64` images, and `arm64` hosts
    build and publish `arm64` images.
28. Native `arm64` publication works on native `arm64` Docker daemons. `docker buildx`,
    cross-arch emulation, and mixed-arch cluster closure are not part of the supported lifecycle
    or chart-delivery path.
29. Every supported Helm-managed PostgreSQL deployment is external, reconciled only through the
    cluster-wide Percona operator, and runs Patroni HA with exactly three PostgreSQL replicas,
    synchronous replication, and no embedded chart-local PostgreSQL subchart.
30. Pulumi remains part of the supported architecture for true IaC and AWS validation resources.
    The public `prodbox pulumi ...` surface stays limited to those stacks, while local-cluster
    lifecycle, bootstrap DNS reconcile, and ACME `ClusterIssuer` projection remain owned by
    `src/Prodbox/CLI/Rke2.hs` rather than by a public Pulumi operator flow.
31. No supported Pulumi program depends on Python.
32. The strongest clean-room rerun passes from full local delete through final AWS teardown using
    the Haskell stack.
33. [legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md](legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md) contains no unresolved
    cleanup.
34. The repository has no supported-path Python implementation or Python toolchain ownership
    artifacts left.
35. The Haskell gateway daemon materializes peer transport from the certificate, key, CA, and
    socket fields already retained in `DaemonConfig` and `Orders`: every node updates
    `stateLastHeartbeatTimes` from inbound peer events rather than from the local heartbeat loop
    only, the append-only commit log replicates between nodes as the canonical heartbeat-and-event
    transport, and `/v1/state` exposes per-peer transport health for operator inspection.
36. The gateway daemon emits signed `Claim` and `Yield` events on owner transitions and gates
    Route 53 writes on the runtime equivalent of the modelled `CanWriteDns` predicate, so
    `ClaimPrecedesWrite` and `YieldPrecedesReclaim` hold on the runtime event log rather than only
    on the model, and a stale owner cannot reclaim DNS write authority without first observing its
    own yield being superseded by a fresh claim.
37. The supported-host gate fails fast when the host's NTP synchronization state is unhealthy, the
    gateway daemon records the maximum observed inter-node clock skew on `/v1/state` and refuses
    inbound heartbeats whose timestamps exceed the documented bound, and the architecture and TLA+
    correspondence docs name that bound, the operator response, and how the model's bounded-delay
    assumption maps to a runtime-enforced skew limit.
