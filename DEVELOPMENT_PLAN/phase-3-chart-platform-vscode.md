# Phase 3: Haskell Chart Platform and Cluster-Backed `vscode` Delivery

**Status**: Authoritative source
**Supersedes**: N/A
**Referenced by**: [README.md](README.md), [00-overview.md](00-overview.md),
[system-components.md](system-components.md)

> **Purpose**: Capture the Haskell chart platform, deterministic retained storage model, and the
> supported cluster-backed `vscode` delivery path.

## Phase Summary

This phase ports the chart platform and retained-storage orchestration to Haskell while preserving
deterministic PV/PVC rebinding and the supported cluster-backed `vscode` delivery model. It owns
retained storage, Harbor-backed image sourcing for the supported chart stack, the
`vscode-nginx` image exception under the repository Docker doctrine, and the PostgreSQL doctrine
for every Helm-managed application stack. This phase is closed on its repository-owned surfaces.
The supported chart platform remains Haskell-owned, the `vscode` stack stays on Harbor-backed
images after Harbor bootstrap, and the PostgreSQL doctrine for every Helm-managed application
stack is the implemented Percona-operator-backed Patroni HA path: exactly three replicas,
synchronous replication, and no embedded chart-local PostgreSQL subchart.

## Current Baseline In Worktree

- The public `prodbox charts ...` runtime lives in `src/Prodbox/CLI/Charts.hs`,
  `src/Prodbox/Lib/ChartPlatform.hs`, `src/Prodbox/Lib/Storage.hs`, and
  `src/Prodbox/PostgresPlatform.hs`.
- Retained roots remain the configured manual PV root (default `.data/`) and `.prodbox-state/`;
  chart secret resolution and gateway event-key handling are Haskell-owned.
- `docker/nginx-oidc.Dockerfile` remains the permitted `nginx:1.25-alpine` exception and is
  published to Harbor before supported deployment.
- The supported app dependency graph remains `keycloak-postgres -> keycloak -> vscode`, with
  `keycloak-postgres` owning the namespace-local application-database release for the root chart
  namespace.
- The current worktree now installs the Percona `pg-operator` Helm release, mirrors the Percona
  operator and PostgreSQL images, renders `PerconaPGCluster` resources for
  `keycloak-postgres`, and removes the incompatible legacy Zalando operator release before the
  Percona install proceeds on a live cluster.
- Sprint `3.3` keeps the namespace-local release shape, deterministic manual-PV bindings,
  retained-secret contract, and dependent-chart sequencing on the Percona operator surface.
- `keycloak` now consumes the namespace-local retained Patroni credentials secret and the namespace-local
  primary service endpoint instead of a shared `pgpool` service.
- `src/Prodbox/TestPlan.hs` maps the chart validation names to executable native validations in
  `src/Prodbox/TestValidation.hs`.

## Sprint 3.1: Haskell Chart Runtime and Deterministic Retained Storage ✅

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `src/Prodbox/CLI/Charts.hs`, `src/Prodbox/Lib/ChartPlatform.hs`, `src/Prodbox/Lib/Storage.hs`, `test/unit/Main.hs`, `test/integration/cli/Main.hs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/cli_command_surface.md`, `documents/engineering/helm_chart_platform_doctrine.md`, `documents/engineering/storage_lifecycle_doctrine.md`, `documents/engineering/unit_testing_policy.md`

### Objective

Move chart orchestration and retained-storage handling to Haskell without changing the supported
platform doctrine.

### Deliverables

- `prodbox charts list|status|deploy|delete` are implemented in Haskell.
- Deterministic retained storage under the configured manual PV root remains intact.
- `.prodbox-state/` remains the canonical retained non-PV chart-state root.
- Chart secret resolution and gateway event-key handling move to Haskell-owned modules.

### Validation

1. `prodbox check-code`
2. `prodbox test unit`
3. `prodbox test integration charts-storage`
4. `prodbox test integration charts-platform`

### Current Validation State

- `test/unit/Main.hs` proves deterministic Haskell chart-plan and storage-binding behavior.
- `test/integration/cli/Main.hs` proves native built-frontend `prodbox charts
  list|status|deploy|delete` behavior against fake `helm` and `kubectl`.
### Remaining Work

None.

## Sprint 3.2: Haskell `vscode` Stack Delivery and Auth Path ✅

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `charts/`, `docker/nginx-oidc.Dockerfile`, `src/Prodbox/Lib/ChartPlatform.hs`, `src/Prodbox/TestPlan.hs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/cli_command_surface.md`, `documents/engineering/helm_chart_platform_doctrine.md`, `documents/engineering/local_registry_pipeline.md`, `documents/engineering/unit_testing_policy.md`

### Objective

Preserve the supported cluster-backed `vscode` stack while moving its deployment orchestration and
image sourcing to the canonical Harbor-first doctrine.

### Deliverables

- The supported app path is `external PostgreSQL -> keycloak -> vscode`.
- `vscode-nginx` remains the namespace-local auth proxy behind Traefik.
- `vscode-nginx` is loaded into Harbor before deployment and referenced from Harbor on the
  supported path.
- The Haskell chart runtime owns deploy, status, and delete behavior for the `vscode` stack.
- Both `amd64` and `arm64` variants of the auth-proxy image are published or loaded irrespective
  of the architecture of the machine running `prodbox`.

### Validation

1. `prodbox test integration charts-platform`
2. `prodbox test integration charts-vscode`
3. Image-source proof: the supported chart or rendered manifests reference Harbor for
   `vscode-nginx`
4. Harbor proof: both `amd64` and `arm64` variants of the auth-proxy image are available

### Current Validation State

- `src/Prodbox/TestPlan.hs` keeps `prodbox test integration charts-vscode` on the supported
  runtime bootstrap path rather than bypassing the cluster runbook.
- `src/Prodbox/TestRunner.hs` waits for `prodbox host public-edge` to report
  `CLASSIFICATION=ready-for-external-proof` before the external `charts-vscode` curl proof
  continues.
### Remaining Work

None.

## Sprint 3.3: Percona-Operator-Backed Patroni PostgreSQL Doctrine for Helm Workloads ✅

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `src/Prodbox/PostgresPlatform.hs`, `src/Prodbox/Lib/ChartPlatform.hs`, `src/Prodbox/ContainerImage.hs`, `charts/`, `test/`
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/cli_command_surface.md`, `documents/engineering/helm_chart_platform_doctrine.md`, `documents/engineering/local_registry_pipeline.md`, `documents/engineering/storage_lifecycle_doctrine.md`, `documents/engineering/unit_testing_policy.md`

### Objective

Replace the current Zalando `postgres-operator` application-database doctrine with
Percona-operator-backed external Patroni HA PostgreSQL for every Helm-managed PostgreSQL
dependency.

### Deliverables

- Every supported Helm-managed PostgreSQL dependency consumes an external
  Percona-operator-backed Patroni HA deployment rather than an embedded chart-local PostgreSQL
  subchart or the current Zalando operator surface.
- Every supported Patroni deployment runs exactly three PostgreSQL replicas with synchronous
  replication enabled.
- The only supported Helm role for Patroni is the cluster-wide Percona operator release plus the
  namespace-local application charts that render Percona-managed PostgreSQL custom resources,
  secrets, and dependent service inputs.
- Patroni-related images and Helm repository references are Harbor-backed or lifecycle-owned on
  the supported path after Harbor bootstrap.
- `keycloak`, `vscode`, and any later PostgreSQL-backed chart stack declare external database
  connectivity instead of rendering or depending on embedded PostgreSQL.

### Validation

1. `prodbox check-code`
2. `prodbox test unit`
3. `prodbox test integration charts-platform`
4. `prodbox test integration charts-vscode`
5. Helm proof: `prodbox rke2 install` reconciles the cluster-wide Percona operator before
   namespace-local application charts deploy
6. Manifest proof: supported chart renders disable embedded PostgreSQL and target
   Percona-operator-managed service endpoints and custom resources
7. Image-source proof: Patroni-related chart workloads reference Harbor-backed images on the
   supported path

### Current Validation State

- `src/Prodbox/CLI/Rke2.hs` now installs the Percona `percona/pg-operator` Helm release from
  `https://percona.github.io/percona-helm-charts/` and removes the incompatible legacy
  `postgres-operator` release before that install when needed.
- `src/Prodbox/PostgresPlatform.hs` now defines the Percona operator namespace, release,
  deployment, CRD, service, and secret naming contract, including
  `perconapgclusters.pgv2.percona.com`, the `-ha` primary service, the `-replicas` service, and
  the Percona secret names for the application, superuser, and standby credentials.
- `src/Prodbox/Lib/ChartPlatform.hs` now renders `keycloak-postgres` through
  `PerconaPGCluster`, waits for `.status.state=ready` plus `.status.postgres.ready=3`, discovers
  the operator-created PVC names before binding deterministic retained PVs, preserves the
  retained Patroni credential flow into `keycloak`, preserves the ordinal-0 retained anchor PV,
  restores retained clusters first at one replica, and then scales them back to three replicas
  after readiness before reinitializing follower roots when needed.
- `src/Prodbox/ContainerImage.hs` now mirrors
  `docker.io/percona/percona-postgresql-operator:2.9.0`,
  `docker.io/percona/percona-distribution-postgresql:17.9-1`,
  `docker.io/percona/percona-pgbouncer:1.25.1-1`, and
  `docker.io/percona/percona-pgbackrest:2.58.0-1` into Harbor and no longer carries any Zalando
  operator image targets on the supported path.
- `charts/keycloak-postgres/` now renders the retained application, superuser, and standby
  credentials secrets before the Percona cluster resource, alongside three replicas,
  synchronous mode, explicit security IDs `1001`, and deterministic manual-PV bindings.
- `charts/keycloak/` now consumes the namespace-local retained database secret and the namespace-local
  primary service endpoint.
### Remaining Work

None.
